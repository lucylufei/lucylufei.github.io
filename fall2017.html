	And so it begins. Yet another school year commences at the reddening maple leaves and cooling temperatures. Another year of dedicating my time to the constant procession of academics. It's quite intimidating to remember that this would be my 16th year in the education system. 
	</p>

	<p>
	The first little bit was still filled with nalstogic thoughts of the summer and my inability to accept changes. I didn't want anything to be different - not my carefree mood, not my food spree and shopping spree, not my incessant coffee and alcohol consumption, and certainly not my constant outings with friends. There were so many people I wanted to see and so much preparation that I hadn't bothered to engage myself in. That, combined with my natural tendency to remain blind to consequences led me to overcommit. Suddenly I found myself commuting 3 hours each day to tackle my standard 3rd year engineering courses as well as a minor in commerce and spending all my spare time between the two courses I'd agreed to TA and the two kids I'd agreed to tutor. Gone were all my hopes to continue living as I had in"fall. 
	</p>	

	<p>
	Of course, the world is fair and balanced and just as I was about to hit my break point, I found out I finally got a spot in residence at UBC. Some hidden twisted subconscious need to always occupy my time almost led me to decline this glorious offer sent by angels, but luckily I came to my senses and moved into my new place.

	Let's take a moment here to talk about my new roommates, a German girl who grew up in Vancouver, a first year international student from China, and a Japanese exchange student here to learn English. They're great people and we seem to be getting along just fine. Nevertheless, there are certain things you find out about people when you live with them, and the German girl most definitely kept my life intriguing. 
	</p>

	<p>
	My very first impression of her wasn't actually from her. The only person I really had a chance to talk to the day I'd moved in was the Chinese girl. It was her that informed me the drama that awaited. She warned me a constant stream of Japanese guys occupying our shared living room. Of course, my immediate thought was that they were here for the pretty Japanese girl, but little did I know she had nothing to do with it all. The following day, and the next, and the one after that enforced a not entirely positive view of the girl who was constantly circled by not a few but a pack of male exchange students clearly trying to get with her and her not-so-innocent reciprocation. Some of them were still there at the breakfast table in the morning. More recently, I've been greeted by her showcasing her hickeys and the sound of a male voice mixed in with hers coming from inside the shower.

	I moved in around the time of my 20th birthday. It was the world's beautiful gift to me. It was also one of the only gifts I'd received this year for my birthday at no fault of others. This was the first year that I no longer felt the excitement and need to celebrate. Instead, I simply felt old, unaccomplished, and depressed. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Most people around me seemed to have experienced some form of a quarter-life crisis before embracing the new reality of adulthood. Needless to say, the same happened with me. This year was the first time it really hit me what my career path actually was. I realized with a certainty that I don't want to be an engineer. I've always harboured the belief that regardless of whether I enjoy my future job, I will be happy because work is work and my source of happiness wouldn't be related to the job anyway. It's only recently that I'm starting to understand the importance of finding job in what you do. I'm incredibly jealous of those around me who find the tedious circuits we're studying to be fascinating. I'm still not sure where my path will lead me. Perhaps I might even discover my passion.

	My friends still insisted upon a birthday dinner despite my protests. It was a kind gesture at its core, but the execution was very questionable. After a week of pestering me to make a decision on where to eat after I suggested American food, I'd finally settled on Cactus Club Cafe. Within hours, that plan was disregarded and would never see the light of day. Instead, after a long 7 hours of work and a stressful week of classes, I sat in traffic and looped multiple times to find a parking spot for the Chinese restaurant, only to discover they had ordered without me and had no plans of having me eat with them. So I sat there in silence for the entirety of the meal until we made our way to dessert. In hindsight, I probably could have responded better, but in the moment it was all I could do not to get up a leave. It's not that my friends had been inconsiderate, but rather they've considered too much. The simple fact that they knew me better than I know myself is what destroyed the night. Nevertheless, cake always fixes everything.

	More importantly, Laifu turned 4 this year, making him officially much older than me in dog years. Overwhelmed by adulthood, I chose to spend all my excitement and energy on Laifu's birthday. He had all the miscellaneous birthday paraphernalia that I'd always wanted for my birthday - the customized birthday cake, the metallic helium number balloons, the showering of birthday gifts and treats. Everything I wanted have now been projected onto my dog and I really do feel the same amount of joy. It makes sense now to me why parents fuss over their children for often little gratification in return.

 	Life is always full of ups and downs. I think it's important to remind myself of this every once in a while. Things seem to always balance out, and nothing is ever as big of a deal as it may appear. As much as I repeat this little fact to myself, I still can't help but feel the panic of the next midterms and the stress of the next projects. School seems to just never end and perhaps it's better this way since I can't even accept adulthood.
