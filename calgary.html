	I arrived in Calgary on a Sunday and immediately felt a wave of homesickness wash upon me. Navigating alone for the first time through the YYC airport, struggling to keep my emotions in check, I felt my heart sink after finding the tiny conveyor belts spinning luggage around in never ending circles. My luggage accounted for around 50% of the entire belt. Every suspicion that I had left city life was confirmed in that short moment. It was reinforced even more as I made my way around downtown after reluctantly settling in to my new apartment, only to find that everything had closed at 5PM. The stores were closed, the streets were empty, and even the chairs in the patios of all the restaurants on Stephen Avenue were stacked up. I’ve wandered into a ghost town, I thought to myself. Never in my life had I been so ready for the summer to be over. 
	</p>
	<p>
	But that was then, and this is now. It feels a little like my world has shifted in just the past three months. I’ve watched so many people around me change when they leave home and come back a different person altogether, and it’s finally my turn. I haven’t changed significantly, but to those observant people who look just a little beyond the surface, I can never be the same Lucy that left Vancouver.

	My first day at work was nerve wracking because I didn’t know what to expect at all. Yet, clearly I wasn’t nervous enough because I still missed the C-Train I was supposed to catch. Luckily, I’d prepared for the worst and padded my commute time so much that, even choosing to walk the 20 minutes from the train to Hopewell, I was still a little early. I learned quite quickly after finally entering the building that a dress code did not exist and my carefully planned outfit was far too formal for the Shaw office setting. I felt like a beacon, standing bright and calling unnecessary attention. Regardless, I wore those same business casual outfits to work every single day of the work term.

	I was given my corporate brainwashing immediately, with a slide set that only marked the coverage map as confidential. Why that is, I still do not understand. It was almost an ironic presentation as I sat and waited in awkward silence for 15 minutes before the Wi-Fi (at a company providing Wi-Fi) finally decided to load the presentation. I didn’t really learn anything that day about what I was doing for the summer, but I did learn all about Shaw’s mottos because that’s what’s important. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I also met my co-op partner that day. Never in a million years could I have predicted that we’d become such close friends. All that was on my mind then was the disappointment that he wasn’t Asian. In that initial week, all I could really say is that he was a nice and talkative person that I tried really hard to not shut myself off from. It was incredibly amazing to me when he offered to drive me to work the very next day and it took many days after that before I could finally confirm it wasn’t a move.
