	I arrived in Calgary on a Sunday and immediately felt a wave of homesickness wash upon me. Navigating alone for the first time through the YYC airport, struggling to keep my emotions in check, I felt my heart sink after finding the tiny conveyor belts spinning luggage around in never ending circles. My luggage accounted for around 50% of the entire belt. Every suspicion that I had left city life was confirmed in that short moment. It was reinforced even more as I made my way around downtown after reluctantly settling in to my new apartment, only to find that everything had closed at 5PM. The stores were closed, the streets were empty, and even the chairs in the patios of all the restaurants on Stephen Avenue were stacked up. I’ve wandered into a ghost town, I thought to myself. Never in my life had I been so ready for the summer to be over. 
	</p>
	<p>
	But that was then, and this is now. It feels a little like my world has shifted in just the past three months. I’ve watched so many people around me change when they leave home and come back a different person altogether, and it’s finally my turn. I haven’t changed significantly, but to those observant people who look just a little beyond the surface, I can never be the same Lucy that left Vancouver.

	My first day at work was nerve wracking because I didn’t know what to expect at all. Yet, clearly I wasn’t nervous enough because I still missed the C-Train I was supposed to catch. Luckily, I’d prepared for the worst and padded my commute time so much that, even choosing to walk the 20 minutes from the train to Hopewell, I was still a little early. I learned quite quickly after finally entering the building that a dress code did not exist and my carefully planned outfit was far too formal for the Shaw office setting. I felt like a beacon, standing bright and calling unnecessary attention. Regardless, I wore those same business casual outfits to work every single day of the work term. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I was given my corporate brainwashing immediately, with a slide set that only marked the coverage map as confidential. Why that is, I still do not understand. It was almost an ironic presentation as I sat and waited in awkward silence for 15 minutes before the Wi-Fi (at a company providing Wi-Fi) finally decided to load the presentation. I didn’t really learn anything that day about what I was doing for the summer, but I did learn all about Shaw’s mottos because that’s what’s important. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I also met my co-op partner that day. Never in a million years could I have predicted that we’d become such close friends. All that was on my mind then was the disappointment that he wasn’t Asian. In that initial week, all I could really say is that he was a nice and talkative person that I tried really hard to not shut myself off from. It was incredibly amazing to me when he offered to drive me to work the very next day and it took many days after that before I could finally confirm it wasn’t a move.

	The second day of work was arguably the most boring day all summer. The clock slowly ticked by the morning until lunchtime. I ate lunch with my co-op partner and another one of the nine co-op students working at Shaw. Little did I know he was in all the same classes as my ex. Even littler did I know that I’d inform him of this fact. The world is too small. 
	</p>
	<p>
	That week was spent in the much more preferable Shaw building that we meant to leave behind after our month of training but never actually did. We met the Service Management team and quickly embedded ourselves into all their meetings and their process. The week went by more quickly mixed in with the lively team, and once our ServiceNow training began. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Friday was when I met more of the nine co-op students. It took every ounce of my being to drag myself to the dinner that I dreaded all day. Every part of me was too introverted to meet these people, except for the one piece that knew I couldn’t possibly enjoy my time here if I didn’t at least try to make friends. I’m very glad I went because that was the first time I really talked to a certain someone. Never would I have foreseen our relationship to come.

	The first few weeks consisted mostly of walking by the river, running by the river, and staring at the river. It also consisted of spending more money than I should, trying to come to terms with the fact that I was now in Calgary. I didn’t know what to do with myself so I spent a lot of time on Tinder and Tantan and started watching Netflix. Life was pretty sad for a bit. I met two guys, and both of them were very great. Neither of them is very dateable. My dreams for finding a boyfriend in Calgary were quickly crushed. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the free dinners and dessert dates, and especially being driven around.

	A few more activities were planned between the co-ops. We went for a hike in Banff, a walk through the Glenbow museum, and a night of board games at Hex. It quickly became clear that it was the same people showing up to every event. Maybe it was better this way; we had so much fun together every time. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Our hike in Banff was barely a hike, but the view was absolutely gorgeous. I’d forgotten how beautiful the little town is with the snowy mountains so close in the background. The mountains were in every direction you turned and green spanned the area below with the Bow River weaving in and out of sight. The food was good, the view was good, and the people were good. It was a good day. And at the end of that good day, the five of us climbed back into a little car named Ray and headed back to Calgary. That was also the first time I tried Peter’s Drive-In. The place could literally be a carwash and I would not have suspected a thing, but I do admit their milkshakes were very on point. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The Glenbow was interesting. I’ve never been too fond of museums and art, but given the choice between sitting at home and being with people, I apparently chose the latter. It was a lot easier for me to get myself to commit to these activities when my co-op partner was there. Especially that day, when the timing worked out perfectly after he got yet another flat tire. The only mistake was showing up in heels. I can feel the happiness drain out of my soul the longer I stand in heels. We proceeded to spend the majority of the night ignoring the exhibits and having a vivid discussion of every taboo dinner topic, ranging from polities to morality. I didn’t have a single contribution to the debate but that’s the only way I can really ever take in others’ opinions. I think at the end of that night, we all knew each other just a little bit better. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My favourite time was definitely the board game night. It didn’t have the greatest start, but once Card Against Humanity came out, the night significantly improved. It was so much fun to just throw away insecurities and play the games. A little alcohol plus a lot of laughter is a good recipe for success. The best game of all was Telestrations. Never have I ever enjoyed drawing as much as I did that night. We ended up staying there till past midnight because we’re all just a bunch of nerds spending their Saturday night in a café.

	Time actually passes quite quickly, and soon enough, it was Stampede season. Foreseeing that I wouldn’t have anything to do, I purchased the Super Pass with my co-op partner and together we planned to attend all 10 days of Stampede. The first day was very disappointing. No one informed me that “Sneak-a-Peek” isn’t really the start, and no one really goes. It was the stereotypical fair, except with probably more people attending booths than strolling around. Despite this, I continued to go for a total of 9 times over the length of Stampede. The first few days were fueled by the desire to taste the long craved for Raindrop Cake, and as soon as that happened, my motivation to go dropped significantly. From there it was a series of drunken nights and gambling away money. I promise I don’t have a problem. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Amidst it all was our trip to Lady Macdonald. Despite words of caution, we decided it was a good idea to tackle an expert difficulty hike. If my roommate could do it, why can’t I? I completely underestimated just how high and steep that mountain really was. Never have I been so ready to jump over the side of the cliff. About 90 minutes in was when I wanted to cry because the end was not even close. Eventually, though, we did make it to the top. The view was astonishing, but my body refused to let me enjoy the simplest of things. The high elevation gave me a headache and somehow made all my fingers swell up. I also fell on the way down. Needless to say, I never want to see that mountain again in my life. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I don’t remember much of that week, but a lot of alcohol was involved. I did everything Stampede had to offer. I went on the rides, I won a giant teddy bear, I bet far too much money away, I ate as much greasy food as my body could handle, I wore a cowboy hat with a plaid shirt but sadly no cowboy boots, I watched people race on horses, I saw the dog show half a dozen of times and never got tired of it, I got to watch Marianas Trench and Alessia Cara live, and I watched the underrated grandstand show with fireworks at the end. I experienced literally everything there is to experience at Stampede and I never want to be there again.

	It was a hard adjustment back to a regular work week after those 10 cowboy packed days. I told myself I was done with alcohol, but I guess that was a lie. The very next weekend was again filled with drinks and late nights. I had my very first shot, followed by 3 more. It was also the weekend that I discovered yogurt Soju. I’ve tried Soju before and I swear that stuff tastes like dish soap. It’s odd that just by adding some Calpico, it becomes the best drink I’ve ever had. We downed two jugs of it while at Karaoke. Karaoke was so much more fun with alcohol. Everything is. The best part, however, is probably that for the first time in my life, I was with someone who actually had the same taste in music as me. It was one of my favourite nights in Calgary.

	The next day was the start of a beautiful… companionship? There really is no word to describe exactly what we had. Some days I wonder if it happened because I was lonely or if there really was something there. We went to a café that day; then he took me around Calgary to some of his favourite places. A few more café dates followed. I switched from alcohol everyday to multiple coffees everyday. We had some really nice times. I couldn’t help but be frustrated with him sometimes because things get complicated when emotions come in. But that’s the best thing about slapping on an end date. I knew I would never see him again after the summer and that simple fact helped me appreciate every moment with him that much more. There’s also just something mystic about not knowing and not dwelling on what could have been.

	Towards mid August, everything started winding down. There’s a little period of time each summer after spending way too much time with the same people but just before the end is near enough to let things slide when everyone is mad at everyone. It’s my least favourite time but it always seems to be unavoidable.
 	</p>
	<p>
	What comes after, though, is serendipity. There’s a sort of acceptance where people start to realize time is fading away and the things that were bothersome no longer mattered. I tried my best to make the most of my last few weeks and spent the majority of my days out. Somehow there seemed to always be something going on. Weekends were filled with alcohol and fun activities, from mini golf to go karting to hikes. Weekends were also filled with a lot of food and I definitely gained more weight than I would like to admit just over the one month. 
 	</p>
	<p>
	The last week in Calgary was actually quite sad. Monday was the last time we got all the co-ops together. We went to an escape room and worked together one last time, then sat in a café and just talked. I never imagined I would become close with any of them, but I can confidently say they were all amazing friends and I couldn’t have had this brilliant experience without them. By Wednesday, people were already leaving and their absence couldn’t be ignored. A round of bowling later and more of them were gone.

	The last day of work was bittersweet. The morning consisted of endless goodbyes with carefully worded emails to almost everyone we’d crossed paths with over the summer. What was supposed to be the last game of air hockey was cruelly taken away from us when we discovered the air hockey puck was nowhere to be found. Maybe it’s better this way, without any winners or losers. The afternoon was spent fooling around. Our new business analyst brought Nerf guns for everyone as a parting gift and I’m sure anyone can imagine how that went down. We played a few games of GeoGuessr and left Barlow for the last time ever. Hopewell was filled with more goodbyes. I’ve never been a fan of goodbyes but they’ve also never meant as much to me as they did this past summer. Everything felt like an end. 
 	</p>
	<p>
	After work, we all went out for drinks. The last of my drunken Calgary days. It was dreadful again, as slowly everyone had to leave. A lot of hugs were exchanged and that was that. I went out for one last meal with my co-op partner. We bonded so much over the summer that it felt insane to imagine life without each other again. We’d become so intertwined if our day to day actions and everything was attached to some inside joke. We spent that night sitting atop the hill overlooking the city. We always had so much to talk about and it was hard to finally say goodbye. Needless to say, we both cried.

	My last day in Calgary was spent with my favourite person. It was everything I could really ask for. Just spending time with him was the best feeling ever and something I’m going to miss incredibly much. I’ve never met someone so special and it’s been too long since I’ve truly had feelings for someone. I know I said it’s better this way so I don’t dwell, but the truth is that’s all I’ve been doing – thinking about the what-could-have-been’s. By then, he was the only reason holding me back from embracing the trip back to home sweet home. I hope I never forget the amazing times we had together and I hope he will forever remain a part of my life. I miss him so much. 
 	</p>
	<p>
	Nevertheless, Vancouver will forever be what I consider my home; I never thought I'd ever find myself in a situation where I didn't want to go back. Reflecting upon this past summer makes me finally understand that home isn't the place, but rather the people.
