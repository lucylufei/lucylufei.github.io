	Sometimes it's difficult to decide whether academic excellence is still placed upon the high pedestal it once was. While to me, it will forever be a valid indicator of one's intelligence and work ethics, many say it's not inclusive enough to represent the entire population. It's often around this time, the end of a semester, that these thoughts revisit me. It's interesting to watch as those exact people who mutter <i> grades don't matter </i> are the ones complaining about professors being unfair or exams being too difficult. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I remember distinctly a particular night out in Calgary. It was a nice celebration with all the other co-op students working at Shaw at the end of our work term. Towards the end of the night, most of us have had a little too much to drink and the not-so-pleasant personality traits were beginning to show. As with any group of people, there are those who don't get along. A conversation sparked some showing off and a rude comment of <i> how could you not know about this </i> , said with the exact tone you'd imagine. The person it was directed to was, of course, almost speechless to this passive insult and a little argument pursued concluding in the implication that he was dumb. I quickly jumped to his defence the only way I knew how. <i> He has the highest GPA of anyone here </i> . I immediately regretted this choice of words as every head turned towards me with a disgusted look as if I had made an incredibly racist comment. I felt every person besides the one I had been defending judging me for measuring intelligence by academics. That moment of silence seemed to have dragged on forever. No one could truly admit that grades are not important, yet no one was comfortable with my judgment of others by their academic success. 
	</p>
	<p>
	It angers me a little how dismissive certain people are of the work and dedication to maintaining a high GPA. I understand that not everyone places such high value in the abstract concept of grades, so a low GPA doesn't necessarily equate to a lack of intelligence or success. But the logic is valid the other way around. No person who is neither incredibly intelligent nor incredibly hard working can possibly achieve the status of the top 5% of the course or the academic year. My friend was in the top 5%. How dare anyone belittle his achievements over one random piece of knowledge that he had never needed? 
	</p>

	<p>
	Similarly, I often find that there are bitter people around who stereotype academically excellent students to compensate for their own failures. Comments about not being privileged enough and having to work in order to pay for their education, or comments about choosing to believe there are more important things in life. So rarely is there ever anyone to defend against these insults. Yet, the moment someone is called stupid for not getting an A, everyone will come to the rescue. No one would ever join in. It is an unfair world we live in, when those who are trying are being punished.

	Recently, marks for courses from this semester were released. For one course, I'd done very well. I found the final exam to be quite easy. So easy, in fact, that I was able to complete it twice within the time allotted. Following the exam, our professor sent out an email detailing the results of the final. He mentioned that the ideal exam would, of course, not require any scaling. The perfect exam would result in the perfect distribution with a perfect representation of how each person in the class understood the concept relatively. Of course no such exam exists, but this year, the highest mark in the final was 148/150, a mark that would not require additional scaling. When this information was passed to us, there were so many who complained, calling the professor unfair or calling out the student with the higest mark for their own failures. I find this to be ridiculous. It would not have made a difference if the test was made to be more difficult and then scaled to the appropriate result. The student with the highest mark is likely to still have received the same mark just as the students who complained would likely still receive the same mark. It's worrisome that there are students who do not seem to grasp this concept. 	
	</p>
	<p>
	Nevertheless, this is simply my point of view and it was been significantly biased by my own experiences.
