1,Clock,Simple JavaScript clock displaying time to the nearest 5 minutes using an array of words and phrases.,./images/clock.JPG,Software,"JavaScript, CSS, HTML",./clock.html
2,Magnetic Tracking Rover,"A rover is built from a blank breadboard, wheels, and sheet metal to track a preprogrammed wire generating a magnetic field detected by inductors. The wire can be user-controlled for real time signals, tracked by the rover to complete commands such as 180 turns.",./images/rover.JPG,Hardware,"Electromagnetics,Circuits",./files/project/291B.pdf
3,Laser Light Show,"A system featuring two self designed DC brush motors, controlled with PID controller in Arduino interface to generate shapes and designs using laser light. The laser has two degrees of freedom to draw any shape inputted by an user through a self-designed GUI",./images/laser.JPG,"Hardware,Software,Simulation","Circuits,Arduino,MATLAB,Altium",./files/project/391.pdf
4,3D Printer Simulation,"Simulation of a 3D laser sintering printer first modeled in Simulink as a block diagram. Then, a PID controller is designed in accordance to root locus and Nyquist criteria to achieve minimal accumulated position error while printing.",./images/printer.JPG,Simulation,"MATLAB,Simulink,PID Control",./files/project/341.pdf
5,Mechanical Claw,"The mechanical claw was built using sheet metal, wires, and a motor controlled using an Arduino microprocessor. The claw is automated and closes around the object it is attempting to pick up when it senses the floor.",./images/2.JPG,"Hardware,Simulation","SolidWorks,Arduino",
6,Marketing Plan,"A marketing plan developed for Rent the Runway through investigation of the company's core competencies, consumer preferences, competition and partners. Ideas were generated using SWOT analysis and with customer segmentation in mind.",./images/rtr.JPG,,"Marketing,SWOT Analysis",./files/project/465.pdf
